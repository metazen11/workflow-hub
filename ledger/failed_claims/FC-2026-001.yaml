claim: >
  BeatBridge assigns correct downbeats >=90% of the time
  across mixed-genre DJ tracks.
test:
  method: gold_set_comparison
  dataset: dj_truth_set_v1 (manual annotations)
failure_condition: accuracy < 0.90
result:
  accuracy: 0.71
  tested_tracks: 47
status: failed
failure_mode:
  - weak_transient_intros
  - swing_rhythms
  - live_drums
  - tempo_drift_in_long_mixes
lesson: >
  Downbeat confidence collapses on non-quantized material.
  The assumption of consistent grid alignment breaks on organic content.
decision: >
  Narrow initial scope to electronic music with strong transient intros.
  Defer live/acoustic support to future version.
revisit: >
  Only if new transient-detection method is introduced,
  or if onset detection is decoupled from grid assumption.
