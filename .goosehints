# Goose Hints for Workflow Hub

## Vision/Image Analysis

When a user message or task description contains file paths to images (.png, .jpg, .jpeg, .gif, .webp):

1. Use the `analyze_image` tool to get a description of the image
2. Or use `preprocess_prompt` tool to automatically augment the prompt with image descriptions

Image paths look like:
- /absolute/path/to/image.png
- ./relative/path/to/screenshot.jpg
- ~/home/path/to/diagram.webp

The vision extension provides these tools:
- `analyze_image`: Analyze a single image file
- `analyze_images_in_text`: Find and analyze all images in text
- `preprocess_prompt`: Augment a prompt with image descriptions (recommended)
- `extract_image_paths`: Just extract paths without analyzing

## Workflow Hub Context

This is an agentic development workflow manager. Key concepts:
- Tasks go through pipeline stages: PM -> DEV -> QA -> SEC -> DOCS -> COMPLETE
- Runs are executions of the pipeline for a task
- Each stage has an agent that processes the handoff

## Project Structure

- `app/` - Django application (models, views, services)
- `scripts/` - Agent runners and utilities
- `tests/` - Test files
- `_spec/` - Specifications and handoffs

## Agent Report Format

When completing work, output a JSON report:
```json
{
  "status": "pass" or "fail",
  "summary": "Brief description of work done",
  "details": { "relevant": "data" }
}
```
